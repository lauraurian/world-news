# Project Starter setup

This repo is intended for having a fork starting point to create a web project.
It includes a few common setup files and folders.

Has:

* `.editorconfig` with a base setup that should be recognized by VSCode
* `.gitignore` with most common ignore files, just in case
* empty `index.html` linked with an empty `main.css`
* `css` and `js` folder for file dependencies
* `assets` folder for any project related files
